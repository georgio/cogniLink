\subsection{List of deliverables}\footnote{If your action taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you must include a data management plan as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 weeks of the project.  This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management. A template for such a plan is available on the Participant Portal (Guide on Data Management).}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making ( including a list of
milestones (table 3.2a))
\item Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project's objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b)

\section{Consortium as a whole} 
\label{sec:consortium}
\instructions{
\emph{The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together? 
\item If applicable, describe how the project benefits from any industrial/SME involvement.
\item \textbf{Other countries:} If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project.

\emph{Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person/weeks, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.}
\vskip0.2cm
Please provide the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item a table showing number of person/weeks required (table 3.4a)
\item a table showing ``other direct costs'' (table 3.4b) for participants where those costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms)

\subsection{‘Other direct cost’ items (travel, equipment, other goods and services, large research infrastructure)}
\instructions{
Please provide a table of summary of costs for each participant, if the sum of the costs for ``travel'', ``equipment'', and ``goods and services'' exceeds 15\% of the personnel costs for that participant (according to the budget table in section 3 of the proposal administrative forms).

\makecoststable


\instructions{
Please complete the table below for all participants that would like to declare costs of large research infrastructure under Article 6.2 of the General Model Agreement, irrespective of the percentage of personnel costs. Please indicate (in the justification) if the beneficiary's methodology for declaring the costs for large research infrastructure has already been positively assessed by the Commission.\\
Note: Large research infrastructure means research infrastructure of a total value of at least EUR 20 million, for a beneficiary. More information and further guidance on the direct costing for the large research infrastructure is available in the H2020 Online Manual on the Participant Portal.
